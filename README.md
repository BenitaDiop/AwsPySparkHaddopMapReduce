### *Leveraging Pyspark, Python, Spark, SQL, SparkR, R and Bash*
*From the terminal all the Yelp Data is pulled from **[Kaggle API](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset)** and pushed to my **[AWS S3 Bucket](https://my-little-pony.s3.amazonaws.com/yelp)** and then pulled into my AWS EMR Cluster to begin analyzing.*
